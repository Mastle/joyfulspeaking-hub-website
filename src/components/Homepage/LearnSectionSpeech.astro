        <p class="fs-5">
          Think of the parts of speech as a chef's ingredients. A chef knows
          exactly how to use each one to build a delicious meal; they aren’t
          just guessing. It’s the same for you and English. Once you understand
          how a verb behaves or what a preposition does, you can stop guessing
          and start building your ideas with confidence. Let’s get cooking,
          together.
