            I have a degree in Applied Linguistics, scored 18 out of 20, and a
            teacher training certificate. I started teaching seriously back in
            high school and have worked with learners of many ages and levels
            since then. I learned a lot from professors and peers, but the most
            important lessons came from the classroom itself, from the mistakes
            we made together and the things that actually worked. That loop of
            trying, failing, and improving is what shaped how I teach today.

            Not at all. The only thing that holds you back is not being honest
            with where you are right now. When you accept your starting point
            and pair that clarity with consistent, focused effort, progress
            follows. It is not magic, it is commitment, and you have more than
            enough fuel to get where you want to go.

            No. Speaking is essential, but grammar is not an enemy. The problem
            is how grammar has been taught in many places. If it is presented as
            a list of rules to memorize, people tune out. But when grammar is
            shown as a tool that explains how language works, it becomes useful
            and empowering. I treat parts of speech as a core interface to
            English. Learn the basics, then use grammar to support real
            practice, not to replace it.

              Any promise of an overnight transformation is a red flag. Mastery
              takes time, focus, and the right fundamentals. That said, a book
              or app can be very useful if it matches your level, keeps you
              engaged, and helps you learn a bit every time you use it. If the
              number of choices is overwhelming, that is a perfect moment to ask
              for guidance â€” I can point you to what actually fits your goals.
