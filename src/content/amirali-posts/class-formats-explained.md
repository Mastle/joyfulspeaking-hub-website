Joyful speaking classes are held in three different forms: 
* in person
* remote
* hybrid


Each of the items above has its own advantages and disadvantages.

 An in person class allows the students to be in direct contact with the body language of the instructor and vice versa which can be beneficial for the learning process. But attending a physical class can be a hassle for people with tight schedules. Also, the class is required to be within the vicinity of the instructor of your choice.


Our remote classes are popular for the ease-of-access they offer. But a common misconception among learners is that remote classes can not be as effective. While its true that certain features are irreplaceable in virtual settings, a remote session has its own upsides. For example, students will receive a PDF file that covers all the notes written by the instructor throughout the session immediately after the class, and each session will be recorded.


We also offer hybrid classes. Some students may not be able to commit to a specific class format for the entirety of a course. In such cases, our instructors make the required adjustments to meet the studentâ€™s needs in both formats.
