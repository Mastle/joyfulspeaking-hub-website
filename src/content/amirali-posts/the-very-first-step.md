Welcome to the Joyful Speaking hub.   

We have all felt the need to improve our English. It could be a requirement at your workplace, or perhaps you’re someone like me who enjoys the elegance and simplicity of the language.  

Even if you belong to neither of these camps, life in the age of technology and the internet  can be daunting for non-English speakers.  


In any case, the value of learning a second language that is present in almost every aspect of our lives can not be overstated.  
Many of us acknowledge this need. And yet, we’re held back by certain misconceptions that have been perpetuated by con artists  and people who are not knowledgeable enough to have a say in the matter.  

Often times those organizations and individuals have been presented to us as the ultimate authority on proficiency in the English Language.
“You’re just not smart enough to learn English!” “ You have to go through at least 5 years (or maybe even more!) of our classes to notice a small change in your English” “You need to buy the X package as well as our special course. So you’d better be ready to spend a fortune on this process”. You’ve probably run into such comments on more than one occasion  

I ask you to forget all of that. Here in joyful speaking, we do no such thing. In fact, I believe you can make a meaningful difference in your English simply by following my weekly blog posts. 

I’ll take you on a journey that’ll gradually give you all the tools and resources you need to learn English. Consistency will be the only requirement. And if you notice that my technique is giving you the results that you were looking for, and you’d like to take it to the next level, you can participate in my classes.  

Best of luck to you in your English Journey!
