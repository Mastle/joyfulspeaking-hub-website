  steps:
    - (current step) Scaffolding the project -> Lay out everything you want to add as static HTML, then begin figuring out what components and layouts you're gonna need
    - Revisit Astro basics (https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#easy-to-use)
    - Import the previous content from the older version of the site as you are building the new one
    - BREAK THROUGH: do think of this website as a magazine, and each blog entry is just a new edition of the magazine. Therefore, try to give the blog the best magazine-like aesthetic that you can based on the current structure of the homepage and what's already there
