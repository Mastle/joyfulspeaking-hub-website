TODO: 
- Modify the hero image to be more relevant to the site - add English, Japanese and Persian text on the whiteboard that the teacher is standing in front of
- the following section that invites users to book a free consultation needs to be reworked - what kind of booking is it when they can only send their email and there is no calendar? this bit is to be revised
- The three pillars of human language have to be shortened so that only some of the text is visible and once the user clicks read more, they can see the whole card
- The rest of the content of the page could use a little touch up for better flow
-
