step: 
          - 
          - It's time to wrap up the development of this thing
          - About page needs to be made
          - What's next is adding the first set of content that represents me well enough as a teacher
          - Anything else will be added later down the line (after remodeling ATP has been finished, and I've been through anotherr round of DSA mastery)
          - so for the first round of content these blogs are needed:
           -- 3 blog posts for each of the three guide cards
           -- 3 blog posts for each section (you'll keep everything super clean, bite-sized and expressive and informative at the same time)
           -- testimonials by siavash, Aryan and Sheyada (they seem like the best of the bunch)
           -- a nice ass photo for the about section? (I might go all in on this and genuinely try to have a pretty professional and authentic looking photo! x) )
           -- remember adding tags for blogs
           -- 
          - BREAK THROUGH: do think of this website as a magazine, and each blog entry is just a new edition of the magazine. 
          herefore, try to give the blog the best magazine-like aesthetic that you can based on the current structure of the homepage and what's already there
