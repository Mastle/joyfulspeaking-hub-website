TODO: 
- Modify the hero image to be more relevant to the site - add English, Japanese and Persian text on the whiteboard that the teacher is standing in front of
- the following section that invites users to book a free consultation needs to be reworked - what kind of booking is it when they can only send their email and there is no calendar? this bit is to be revised
- (final step after deploying the relaunch) CHECK POSTPRODUCTION FOLDER TO KNOW WHICH BLOGPOSTS TO INCLUDE AT RELAUNCH
