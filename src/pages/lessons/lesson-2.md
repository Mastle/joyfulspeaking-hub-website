Lesson Two: Your Living Vocabulary

- I believe this is the most universally applicable lesson for all students
- What might seem like a habit that is difficult to instill in yourself at first, will become the most fun and rewarding way to learn new words
- Crazy thing it’s also the cheapest way to improve your vocabulary
  Now we’ve all heard of countless applications, books and techniques that are used to teach you vocabulary more efficiently, and this one is not here to take the spotlight away from any of those.
  Whatever’s currently your primary way of learning new words, this extra technique can be added to that and it will unlock your potential in ways you’d never thought of. I’d only argue that this is the most fundamental one and it should be where it all begins.
  Let’s get down to business before I try to oversell this thing anymore:
  Your first tool and most fundamental tool can either be a little notebook in your pocket or your favorite note taking app on your cellphone. You can use either the physical or the digital medium for storing your words. What’s important is how you add new words and what words you choose to learn.
  “Strike while the iron is hot” is my motto when it comes to discussing this technique as I consider this bit to be the most essential part of its philosophy as well. What we aim to accomplish with a personal vocabulary notebook (that you should try to have with as often as possible – if it ‘s on your phone, make sure it’s readily accessible. If it’s a notebook, make sure it’s right with you in your back pocket) is to use the momentary frustration of seeing a word that you need but can not fully understand.
  The search has to start with the most essential words for your use case. Let’s say you’ve just started work in the financial sector of the economy, you’re very likely to run into words that are a part of the economics jargon that you haven’t fully mastered yet. You see the words “liquidty” and “equity” on today’s new articles, and while you can fully understand the overall message that the article is trying to convey, you are just bothered that you don’t have a solid grasp of these words. And this exact moment and the strong feeling of frustration that is associated with it is the fuel that we’re gonna utilize to build our personally vocabulary notebook.

Here’s how your notebook is gonna help ya:

- Start by adding both words to your vocabulary notebook
- The next step is to verify that both of these words are on the level of difficulty that is appropriate for you to learn. You have several ways to do this. The easiest one is to use online cambridge dictionary (link Cambridge). You can also ask your instructor or anyone else who you believe to be an reliable source of authority.
- Before we proceed, I’d simply like to remind you that putting this much time into learning a single word is absolutely warranted if you aim to have a good command of the English language
- What’s more is all of this becomes second nature and much faster to redo with the next word. Your vocabulary (and linguistic knowledge in general) will grow exponentially with each attempt
- Now onto the next step: after verifying if learning the word is appropriate for you, it’s time to make sure you fully understand it
- Which brings us to my favorite topic: pat of speech. You can figure out the function of a word (part of speech) by looking it up on google (append image with the part of speech outlined as an example)
- Now, the next step is to read the definition of the word (or look up its equivalent in your first language)
- Here you should come up with a trick that’ll help you memorize the word. I believe you are free to utilize whatever trick you want to memorize the meaning of the word. For example, some words are more memorable when you associate them with a drawing of the concept they represent. Some are easier to remember when you know their equivalent in your first language. Whatever ties you more personally and deeply to that word, that is the type of trick we need here
- By now, you have already been in contact with the word enough to have had a solid grasp of what it might mean and represent.
- My final suggestion: make a sentence with it if you wanna make sure you've FULLY learned it. This is the soundest way to make sure you without a doubt know a word, and it’s more than a superficial awareness of the concept
  (\* You don't have to make a sentence with every word, and there'll be plenty of words that you can only partially understand. it's all gooood if this is what is required of you in your use case for English :)
  There's always time and more place to progress in your English journey ^^ )

This might seem like a lot of chore at first. You might even think: “what’s the point of archiving word in such a detailed manner? Why should I even write words when they are already everywhere on the screens around us? What’s more is there are thousands of words, why should I even devote my time to each one like this?”
To those I say:” fist of all, the price of excellence is eternal vigilance” secondly, several filters are implemented to ensure that you give this much attention and learn with this much depth only when the words are essential parts of your case.
Learning the essential words you need in depth (by making a sentence, picking their part of speech and trying to understand their definition) is without a doubt the most effective boost for your English and linguistic knowledge in general.
Starting this routine feels like being a farmer who has decided to plant their first batch of crops on a huge field that’s never been planted on before. There seems to be lots of overwhelming areas to cover, but as soon as you follow take the right steps, and try to instill this habit in yourself regularly, you’ll become an exceptional farmer who knows when to plant, what to plant, and when is the best to make the most of their crops
Good luck with your linguistic pursuit! Stay tuned for more ya wild cats
