# Lesson Three: Weave English into Your Everyday

> Infusing their daily habits with English based on what they’re learning is the absolute meta for conquering the easy to forget nature of language learning

A big painpoint for all students is to practice what they learn in classrooms effictively (expand on this). Another thing is acquiring the mindset and perception of a native speaker is the ultimate mindset shift that is required to give you complete fluency in the target language (which is English here)

- perhaps you are introduced to this concept as "immersion" - a lot of what I'm saying overlaps with that technique, but what is crucial here is to add the insight you gained into your life in a way that naturally (without forcing you) causes you interact with it again and again. This is why I called “weaving” English into your life

Let's say you learned the months of a year in English in the previous session of your class. You should try as hard as you possibly can to refer to those months in their English version as much as possible! in fact, make it a rule. Make yourself think you have no choice but to only mention them with their English names!

Your knowledge has now become an essential part of your existence that you regularly interact with, and if you manage to make that stick, if you default your brain to use English months, which is a VERY small change on the surface, you're setting up the building the blocks to see the world through the eyes of a native speaker

- You enjoy the English you learned, you’re upgrading your steeze, and you are doing all of this while you enhance your daily routines.

- So you are doing the same things with more focus and better style, and you are reviewing lessons of the past as well

- It’s easy to see how this can turn into such a superpower for all language enthusiast

- It can be something as small and silly as forcing yourself to write down the names of the weeks in English on your personal calendar and forcing yourself to keep it English and use the English pronounce and the English reading of date

- Again, the human brain says: “these are tiny ineffective things” this is what you fully need to rebel against! you are laying the most crucial foundation for mastering a new language

- Start adding these small habitual changes and English routines into your life, and pretty soon, your way of thinking has become so intertwined with the English language that you conveniently and unconsciously make the switch you need to always frame concepts and talk about them just like a real native :)

  - (what I want to be added to this is I want the reader to understand this can be done with anything. They simply need to take the time to put it in a regular part of their life that they experience unintentionally)
  - In other words, you are making your passive knowledge active. You are taking the final step that is needed to ensure you have properly mastered the new concept

   steps:


    - (current step) -> the best way to handle blogs and lessons is to first finalize the CONTENT of all the entries, then focus on styling them! only lesson 3 is left with a Japanase blog post ^_^


    - -> time to add all three lessons. then polish and release
     -> Dude we'll add the three lessons we currently have thought of just as blog posts but on a separate page. This is without doubt the cleanest
     and most efficient way to do this right now. Once I have a couple of lessons that I've added, I'll think of a better way to present them and make the
     lesson page distinct (differnt from writing page)
     -> move on to the blog posts
     - > Make the blog page itself (use the first blog post) look legit AF (blogs gotta look REAL good)
    - Once the blog system is finished and all necessary blog posts have been added, polish the homepage one last time. Make sure eveything works!
    - Remember to add favicon
    - (final step) Must work on and have plans for regular updates on this project :)
    -- remember adding tags for blogs
    - BREAK THROUGH: do think of this website as a magazine, and each blog entry is just a new edition of the magazine.
          herefore, try to give the blog the best magazine-like aesthetic that you can based on the current structure of the homepage and what's already there
