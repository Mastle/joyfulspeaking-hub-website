# Joyful Speaking 2.0

Published on: 2025-10-12

So, it’s been a minute (or like, 6 months…) since I last posted something here. I want to start by saying that the launch of **Joyful Speaking** was much more surprising than I thought!

## Building Joyful Speaking

When I launched **Joyful Speaking**, I was blown away by the praise the website received. It exceeded my expectations, and I have to give a huge shout out to the **Astro team** [link goes here] for their incredible framework — it made building this site surprisingly effortless.

That said, I know this site still has plenty of room for improvement. From a technical standpoint, it’s solid, but I can already think of a dozen ways to make it even better.

The part I’m most shy about, though, is the **design**. Let’s just say there’s a reason I usually leave that to the pros—I’m a frontend dev, not a designer. So while it’s functional and people seem to like it, I know it’s not exactly a visual masterpiece. But hey, that’s what upgrades are for, right?

## Rethinking the Approach

My [first blog post](link it here) brought an unexpected surprise, which, along with my busy dev work schedule—my main profession—led to a hiatus from writing. Joyful Speaking is a side project, but it still holds a special place in my heart.

The unexpected surprise was realizing just how few people take the time to **read** these days, especially lengthy blog posts—it was far fewer than I had anticipated.

I know there are still plenty of nerds out there who devour everything they can get their hands on, but the whole point of teaching English for me is to show the average person just how simple and fun it can be. But that’s hard to do when the average person is so opposed to taking the time to read. It’s kind of the opposite of what learning a new language is all about — engagement, patience, and a willingness to take it slow.

I realized that lengthy blog posts and additional online tutorials aren’t the best way to reach my target audience for learning English. This led me to take a step back and **re-strategize**. Now, I’m excited to take Joyful Speaking in a fresh, new direction.

## Dawn of a New Age

I believe language, like technology or medicine, requires care, attention, and meaningful discussion. Unfortunately, it often gets overlooked because it’s not as profitable. While tech videos rack up millions of views, **language teaching** is increasingly handed off to AI and poorly designed programs.

While AI has its merits, it’s not yet at a point where it can replace the **nuanced, supervised approach** that language learning truly needs—a trend that seems to be accelerating in a concerning direction.

It honestly feels like we’ve forgotten the importance of **expressing ourselves deeply**. True self-expression isn’t possible unless people are given the words to identify their thoughts and feelings. Without an adequate understanding of the language we use, this becomes a struggle. And at the end of the road of unexpressed thoughts and feelings lies a troubling destination: **depression, isolation, and mental illness**—a reality we can’t afford to ignore.

However, I don’t want to focus solely on the negative aspects of the language world. Another surprising revelation came from seeing how much of a **positive impact** a single one-hour session per week had on my students. It brings me joy to witness students who once believed they’d never be able to learn English now confidently write several paragraphs and engage in basic communication.

So, moving forward, I’ll be focusing on keeping the lessons for **in-person classes** or **one-on-one online sessions**.  
Here, however, I’ll explore a range of exciting topics related to **linguistics**, **language**, and my **personal journey** as an English teacher — sharing insights, experiences, and reflections along the way.

## More than Just a Pastime

I believe **poetry** isn’t just a relic of the past. Even if robots can write poems better than any living poet, they still can’t capture the true essence of poetry. It’s about channeling one’s experiences through a methodical arrangement of words and the creative reconstruction of language.

Our ancestors, the poets of old, didn’t simply play with words for amusement; **poetry was a reflection of the magical nature of our reality and language**. The new direction of Joyful Speaking will, hopefully, shed light on this deeper purpose.

Poetry is just one of the many incredibly cool, clever, and yet beautifully simple things we can do with ordinary language. This is why I’ll always fight for **language preservation** with all my heart. Joyful Speaking is now dedicated to exploring and celebrating the **intricacies, beauty, and power of human language**. This is the new direction of my website.

## Final Thoughts

With that, I’d like to wrap up this post by sharing an incredible poem from one of my favorite poets:  
**"Do not go gentle into that good night"** by _Dylan Thomas._

This piece exemplifies the power of language, showing how words can channel deep emotions and experiences.

I’ll be back soon with more awesome, nerdy content related to language. And if you’re someone who wants to dive deeper into linguistics, feel free to reach out — I’d love to discuss it with you!
